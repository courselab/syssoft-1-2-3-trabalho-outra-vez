The exercise was solved by using one of the recommendations brought by the challenge.
What was made was to add a new function using that called the interruption INT 0x12.
This interruption gets the low memory size and stores it in registrator AX. But, before this,
this function gets the XOR of BX and BX. This makes that the registrator BX to initialize, or equals zero.

In the main.c, the function created for the challenge is called and, if it is not empty,
its size is caught by stacking its digits and inverts it.

After this function call, its printed its result.
